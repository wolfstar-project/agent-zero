# Proof and recovery

Use this when code compiles but behavior is unproven, or when imports, discovery, runtime bindings, host output, or deployment fail.

## Select the failing boundary

Use [Verification](https://vitehub.dev/raw/docs/development/verification.md) to choose the proof, [Generated files](https://vitehub.dev/raw/docs/development/generated-files.md) for discovery/binding state, [Errors and diagnostics](https://vitehub.dev/raw/docs/reference/errors-diagnostics.md) for a surfaced ViteHub error, or [Troubleshooting](https://vitehub.dev/raw/docs/development/troubleshooting.md) when the failure does not yet have a boundary. Open one first.

## Recovery loop

1. Reproduce the narrow failing command or request.
2. Inspect installed exports/types for import or option failures.
3. Inspect `.vitehub` registries, generated declarations, and diagnostics for discovery or binding failures.
4. Inspect Provider Output for host failures.
5. Correct the source boundary and rerun the same proof.

Do not add compatibility glue until the installed contract and current docs prove the missing seam is application-owned. Report upstream gaps with the exact package version, docs URL, generated state, and failing observation.

## Proof matrix

| Lane | Required observation |
| --- | --- |
| Server Primitive | Vite Integration registered, Runtime Helper executed, provider effect observed |
| Agent | Driver prerequisites met, Agent Invocation executed, output and authority inspected |
| Channel or Trigger | verified event admitted, invocation observed, delivery or persisted message observed |
| Schedule or Workflow | due/run identity observed, steps executed, retry/terminal state verified |
| Host | build emitted documented Provider Output and live limitation or behavior was checked |

Completion requires every requested behavior to have an observation or a source-backed unsupported boundary.
