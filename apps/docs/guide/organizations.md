# Organizations

The dashboard ships with optional multi-user organizations: teams that share visibility into task history and approvals.

## Enable organizations

Organizations are off unless `AUTH_ENABLE_ORGANIZATIONS` is exactly `true`:

```bash
AUTH_ENABLE_ORGANIZATIONS=true
AUTH_ALLOW_ORGANIZATION_CREATION=true   # whether any signed-in user may create one
```

::: warning Mail transport required
Enabling organizations requires a working mail transport, because invitations are delivered by email. The default `MAIL_PROVIDER=console` only logs — configure `resend` or `smtp` first. See [Mails](/guide/mails).
:::

`AUTH_ALLOW_ORGANIZATION_CREATION` is ignored while organizations are off. When creation is disallowed, only operators (through the database or a seeded flow) create organizations, and users join by invitation.

## How it works

- Organization data (membership, invitations, roles) lives in the Better Auth session store — the same Postgres database, declared in `packages/database`'s Drizzle schema.
- Policy constants such as the membership limit and invitation expiry are defined in `packages/auth` and composed into the Better Auth options.
- The dashboard's organization UI lives in `apps/dashboard/app/modules/organizations/` — pages for creating an organization, managing members, and accepting invitations.
- Like every auth capability, the organization feature flags are captured at build time; rebuild after changing them. See [Authentication overview](/guide/authentication/overview).

Organization authority governs the dashboard UI only — it never extends to the control plane or repository policy. See [Permissions](/guide/authentication/permissions).
