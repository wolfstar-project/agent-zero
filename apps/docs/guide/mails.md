# Mails

`packages/mail` owns transactional email: [Maizzle](https://maizzle.com)-based templates plus a small provider layer. The dashboard uses it for organization invitations and other auth-driven messages.

## Providers

`MAIL_PROVIDER` selects the transport. The default is `console`, which logs instead of delivering — an unconfigured deployment cannot silently attempt real delivery.

| Provider  | Configuration                                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `console` | None. Logs the rendered message. The default; not for production.     |
| `resend`  | `RESEND_API_KEY`                                                      |
| `smtp`    | `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_SECURE` |

`MAIL_FROM` sets the sender address for every provider.

`SMTP_SECURE` selects implicit TLS: `true` on port 465, `false` on port 587 (STARTTLS).

## Templates

Templates are authored with Maizzle and declared in the package's template registry:

- `mailTemplates` maps a `MailTemplateId` to its template file, subject, and context fields;
- `MailTemplateContext` types the data each template needs;
- `maizzle.config.ts` is discovered by Maizzle's own `render()` call by filesystem convention.

Adding a template means adding it to the registry with a typed context, keeping delivery and content concerns separate: providers never know what a template says, and templates never know how mail is sent.

## Compiling templates

Rendering a template runs Maizzle's pipeline — Vue SSR, CSS inlining, plaintext — on top of a Vite SSR server, which needs a bundler with its platform-native binary and a writable working directory. The deployments that send mail are serverless functions with neither, so rendering happens once at build time instead:

```bash
aube run mail:compile
```

That writes `packages/mail/src/util/compiled-templates.json`, which is checked in and bundled into the package. Each template is rendered once per combination of the `conditional` fields the registry declares — the halves a template renders away when empty — with every other field standing in as a placeholder. `sendEmail` then picks the variant its context matches and substitutes the values, escaping them for the HTML part and leaving them bare in the plaintext one.

Run it after editing anything under `packages/mail/emails/`. `aube test` fails when the checked-in artifact no longer matches what the templates render.

## Previewing templates

`apps/mail-preview` wraps Maizzle's dev server around the package's templates:

```bash
aube run mail:preview
```

This serves every template at `http://localhost:3005` with hot reload, rendered against the sample values in `apps/mail-preview/maizzle.config.ts`. The app owns no templates of its own — its `emails/` directory is a symlink into `packages/mail/emails/`, so edits there reload live. Its `build` script compiles every template to static HTML in `apps/mail-preview/dist/`, which CI runs as a template-compilation check.

::: tip Organizations depend on mail
Organization invitations are delivered by email, so enabling [organizations](/guide/organizations) requires a real transport (`resend` or `smtp`).
