/**
 * Tables the Better Enrollment plugin owns.
 *
 * Kept in their own file for the same reason `organization.ts` is: the plugin is optional policy
 * (`AUTH_ENABLE_INVITATIONS`), so a deployment that never turns invitations on still migrates
 * these tables but never writes to them. The same column-naming constraint as `auth.ts` applies —
 * the adapter maps model fields by name.
 *
 * The store deliberately carries no foreign key on `organizationId`, `teamId`, `createdByUserId`,
 * `preCreatedUserId`, or `revokedByUserId`. A redeemed invitation is a permanent audit record of
 * who let whom in, and it has to survive the deletion of the organization, team, or account it
 * names; `inviterName` and `inviterEmail` are denormalized onto the row for exactly that reason.
 * Only `inviteUse.inviteId` cascades, because a use is meaningless without the invite it belongs
 * to.
